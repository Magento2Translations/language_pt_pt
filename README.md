# Maintainance mode
These [Magento2Translations](http://magento2translations.github.io/) packages are updated on a non-regular basis. We have a system in-place to do the updating automatically but running this is still a manual job and requires financial investment to automate.
This means that from time to time we will run the sync and build from Crowdin. If you would like to assist please send us a message.

Magento has started the [Magento Localization](https://github.com/magento-l10n) Community Engineering Project to facilitate translating Magento2.
In the future we might decide to merge this project with [Magento Localization](https://github.com/magento-l10n).
If they have a similar language pack to this one you can find it [here](https://github.com/magento-l10n/language-pt_PT).

Or have a look at all the other great community maintained packages at [e-conomix/magento-translations](https://github.com/e-conomix/magento-translations) and [Mageplaza maintained packages](https://github.com/mageplaza?q=language).
